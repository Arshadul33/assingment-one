                <p>Everyone will look and sound completely different. It’s important that it encapsulates your values
                    and
                    aspirations, and that it makes you feel really good and inspired when you read it aloud.

                <p>Ideally, the vision and mission statement should also be aligned with the values, culture and
                    possibilities of the organization you currently work for. If your personal values and aspirations
                    are
                    being matched by your employer, it will be much easier to progress and fulfill your dreams.</p>

                <p>But somehow that seems to be unclear to many people. The hope of using the new year to drastically
                    change
                    habits & behaviors is astonishingly big. Thus also our goals tend to be enormous.
                    Instead of taking on one new positive habit a week, we try to change everything at once.</p>

            <p>“There are many open source tools for Web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache,
                MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning Web development to a minimum.
                Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG
                Web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge
                of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software,
                but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.”</p>

                <p>“As with any single page application, everything gets bundled into one file that can quickly bloom in
                    size if it does not get kept in check. Tools such as Webpack can help split this bundle up into more
                    manageable chunks that can then be requested as needed.As React encourages creating lots of smaller
                    components, there are plenty of opportunities to break up the bundle. The react-loadable package
                    enables a component to define exactly what it needs to render and Webpack can automatically split up
                    its bundle to accommodate this”</p>
